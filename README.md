# Weather_Predictor
The weather prediction project leveraging machine learning and Python aims to significantly enhance the precision and reliability of weather forecasts by utilizing the strengths of advanced machine learning algorithms. This initiative focuses on processing and analyzing extensive datasets that include historical weather records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website. The data was from Laguardia Airport In Queens New York, I used this airport specifically so I can specify the area of the weather I would be predicting. With this data I integrating Python's comprehensive ecosystem, which includes Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization, the project facilitates in-depth data analysis and model development.

Here is the excel page with all the data from Laguardia Airport: [C:\Users\jmosc\Downloads\3588842.csv](https://1drv.ms/x/c/9e04c823a9430a8a/Ed-mQvqOIx1EhCOUZIkBtm4Bdz8ynpxR3Sm2GxffIiwzRg?e=ThXVgx)
